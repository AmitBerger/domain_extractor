# Domain Extractor

A powerful and lightweight Python tool that extracts, validates, and resolves domain names from text files.

## üìã Overview

Domain Extractor is a command-line, GUI, and web utility that scans text files for domain names, validates their format according to DNS standards, and checks if they resolve to IP addresses. It can optionally query the VirusTotal API to flag domains as malicious, suspicious, or clean. It also provides ASN (Autonomous System Number) and organization info for resolved IPs in the output file. It provides a comprehensive solution for identifying and verifying domains in any text content.

## ‚ú® Features

- üîç **Robust Domain Detection**: Finds domains embedded in text, URLs, HTML, code, and more
- ‚úÖ **DNS Format Validation**: Validates domains according to official DNS naming standards
- üåê **IP Resolution**: Checks if domains resolve to IP addresses
- üõ°Ô∏è **VirusTotal Integration**: Optionally queries the VirusTotal API to mark domains as malicious, suspicious, or clean
- üõ∞Ô∏è **ASN Info in Output**: Adds ASN (Autonomous System Number) and organization info for resolved IPs (in output.txt only)
- üîÑ **Format Normalization**: Handles mixed case, surrounding punctuation, and more
- üß™ **Edge Case Support**: Handles subdomains, IDNs, new TLDs, and challenging formats
- üìä **Detailed Results**: Provides comprehensive output with IP addresses, VirusTotal status, and ASN info (in output.txt)
- üíæ **Download Full Results**: Download the full output.txt (with ASN info) from both the GUI and web interface

## üöÄ Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AmitBerger/domain_extractor.git
   cd domain-extractor
   ```

2. Install requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üñ•Ô∏è Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
python domain_extractor.py input.txt output.txt [virustotal_api_key]
# optional: include your VirusTotal API key to flag malicious domains
```

### Example

```bash
$ python domain_extractor.py webpages.txt domains.txt YOUR_VT_API_KEY
Found 115 potential domains. Checking...
Checking google.com... RESOLVES TO 142.250.72.142
Checking example.org... VALID FORMAT (NO IP)
...
Complete! Found 115 valid domains.
- 75 domains resolve to an IP address
- 40 domains have valid format but no IP
```

### Output Format

The output file contains one domain per line:
- Domains that resolve to an IP address include the IP, VirusTotal status, and ASN info:  
  `google.com 142.250.72.142 VR:clean ASN:AS15169 Google LLC | US`
- Domains with valid format but no IP resolution:  
  `example.org VR:clean`
- **Note:** ASN info is only present in the downloaded output.txt file, not in the GUI or web display.

### Desktop GUI <a id="desktop-gui"></a>

Optional: set your VirusTotal key, then launch the desktop GUI  
Linux/macOS:
```bash
export VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
python GUI.py
```
Windows PowerShell:
```powershell
$Env:VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
python GUI.py
```

**How to use:**
1. Click **Select Text Files** or paste a URL.  
2. Press **Extract** and watch the progress bar.  
3. Copy or save results from the output pane (ASN info is hidden here).
4. **Download the full output.txt** (with ASN info) using the "Download output.txt" button, which is enabled after extraction.

### Web interface <a id="web-interface"></a>

Set your VirusTotal key, then start the Flask back-end  
Linux/macOS:
```bash
export VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
python domain_extractor_server.py
```
Windows PowerShell:
```powershell
$Env:VIRUSTOTAL_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY"
python domain_extractor_server.py
```

Then open your browser ‚ûú **http://127.0.0.1:5000**.

**How to use:**
1. Paste text or upload a file.
2. Click **Extract**.
3. View results in the browser (ASN info is hidden here).
4. **Download the full output.txt** (with ASN info) using the "Download output.txt" button, which is enabled after extraction.

## üîß How It Works

The Domain Extractor follows a three-step process:

1. **Extraction**: Uses regex pattern matching to find potential domains in text
2. **Validation**: Applies DNS naming rules to validate domain format:
   - Checks label length (max 63 chars)
   - Verifies character set (letters, numbers, hyphens)
   - Validates label start/end characters
   - Ensures proper TLD format
   - Confirms overall domain length (max 253 chars)
3. **Resolution**: Attempts to resolve domains to IP addresses and fetches ASN info for resolved IPs (in output.txt only)

## üåü Examples

### Example 1: Extract domains from a web page

```bash
$ python domain_extractor.py webpage.html domains.txt
```

### Example 2: Process log files

```bash
$ python domain_extractor.py server_logs.txt domains.txt
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- The tool does not validate the existence of domains beyond DNS resolution
- Some valid domains may not resolve to IP addresses (e.g., newly registered domains)
- DNS resolution may be affected by network conditions and DNS server configuration
- Very large files may require significant processing time
- VirusTotal Integration: Maliciousness checks require a valid API key without it, domains are still extracted but not flagged
- Performance Impact: Querying VirusTotal for each domain adds network latency and may slow down processing on large lists
- Daily 500 requests limitation from API (for a free user)

## üìä Performance

- Processes approximately 1000 domains per minute on average hardware
- Memory usage scales linearly with input file size
- DNS resolution is the primary performance bottleneck

## üîç Edge Cases Handled

- Domains with multiple subdomains
- Internationalized Domain Names (IDNs)
- Domains with unusual TLDs (.travel, .museum, etc.)
- Domains embedded in complex contexts (HTML, code, etc.)
- Domains with maximum length labels
- Mixed case domains

**Note:**  
- ASN info is only included in the downloaded output.txt file, not in the GUI or web display.
- The "Download output.txt" button is enabled only after a successful extraction in both GUI and web interfaces.
